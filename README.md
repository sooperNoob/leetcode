# leetcode
Here, I would be adding my solution to Leetcode problems.
Most of the solutions would be in C++.

The format that I plan to follow is as follows:
* Each problem would have its own header and code file
* Each file will have multiple solutions of the problem, ranging from the basic naive solution to more optimized solutions
* The cpp file with main() will have pre-processor flags to enable or disabled the parts of the code (including files, calling function etc.)

This folder may no necessarily limit to only leetcode problems. If there will be interesting problems from other sources, they will also be included.
